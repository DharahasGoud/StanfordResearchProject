# Contributing to the Open Source PHY Project

Welcome to the **Open Source PHY** project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. Below are the steps to get involved and make meaningful contributions to this exciting endeavor.

## Project Overview

The **Open Source PHY** project aims to create an open-source mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) design for high-speed links. Our goals include:

1. **Democratizing Knowledge**: By providing an open-source hardware design, we empower engineers, researchers, and students to explore and innovate in the silicon space.

2. **Portability and Reproducibility**: We focus on creating designs that are portable across technology nodes and reproducible using standard tools. This ensures accessibility and ease of adoption.

3. **Collaboration**: We encourage collaboration within the community. Your contributions play a vital role in advancing the project.

## How to Contribute

Follow these steps to contribute effectively:

1. **Stay Up-to-Date**:
   - Ensure you have the latest changes from the master branch:
     ```
     git pull origin master
     ```

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Name your branch based on the feature you're working on. For example:
     ```
     git checkout -b new_sampler
     ```

3. **Make Code Changes**:
   - Modify the code as needed and commit your changes:
     ```
     git commit -am "Description of changes"
     ```

4. **Push Your Code**:
   - Push your code back to GitHub:
     ```
     git push origin NAME_OF_YOUR_BRANCH
     ```

5. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Visit the [Open Source PHY GitHub repository](https://vlsi.stanford.edu/research/open-source-phy).
   - Click on "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request."
   - Set the "base" to master and compare it to your branch.
   - Add a title and description for your pull request, then click "Create Pull Request."

6. **Test and Merge**:
   - If the tests pass, you can merge the pull request.
   - If the tests fail, make necessary modifications and push them to your branch.
